Hi! My name is Prasanna. I am data engineer, programmer who works mainly on data related tech stack, cloud (mostly AWS), python and scala.
With over a decade of experience, I have gained considerable knowledge and experience in the area of data engineering and cloud services (primarily AWS). Usually work on data engineering technologies such as Apache Spark, Kafka, Hive and the once-upon-a-time Hadoop!!. Since, we engineers, adopt and follow DevOps practices, I am also interested in learning and working with DevOps tools and technologies.

What I do, in short...

* Design, development, and maintenance of data processing batch and streaming pipelines.
* Building microservices.
* Building serverless applications.
* Command+tab between Pycharm, IntelliJ for Scala and miswriting the syntax out of confusion :P . Also, learning Golang!
