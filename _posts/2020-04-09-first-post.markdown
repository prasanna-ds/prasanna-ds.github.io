Hello!!!! It's my first post on my blog site!!!! 

After years of experience in IT, I have decided to start a technical blog to give the world what I learnt at work or from my time to time personal learning.

To be brief, I started this journey as a mainframe developer in the year 2009. I worked on data warehousing projects using Mainframes and Cobol (yes! the 60 yr old programming language). After 3 years, I got a chance to work on Informatica where I wrote complex transformations to achieve business requirements. About a year later, the buzzwords "big data" and "Hadoop", hit us hard and in no time, everything became legacy with migration plans on board. Rest has been an amazing data ride..

Down the years, I started to work on Spark, Kafka, AWS, Docker, Python, Scala, Node.js, and became comfortable of the following exhaustive list,

Bigdata Processing Engines: Hadoop, Spark
Streaming Engines: Kafka Streams, Spark Streaming
Cloud: AWS
Languages: Scala, Python, Node.js
IaC: Terraform
CI/CD: Buildkite, Bamboo 
Deployments: Docker, Kubernetes
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana
NoSQL: HBase, ElasticSearch
Workflow Orchestration: Airflow


Am a jack of all guy, So I always try to learn things deeper to be more than just a jack!


I will try to be disciplined by posting a few times in a month at the least. My posts would be usually around the above list and could be of any level from beginner to intermediate. Because everyone is a learner their whole life and let's be a learner!!!

See you soon !!!
